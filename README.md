103:
Cryptography is a very old science, whose goal is to secure communication, so that only its recipient couldread it.
There are a lot of methods to encrypt a message,
From the simplest (such as the 2,000-year-old Caesarcipher) to the most complex (such as the World War 2 Enigma code);
They all need both encryption anddecryption keys (sometimes identical).
In some cases (such as the Hill cipher),
the key is represented by a matrix.You have to carry out such a matrix-based ciphering software,
using the following process to encrypt :

•Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first,

•Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size,and its number of lines should be as small as possible,

•Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message
