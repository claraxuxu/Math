103:
Cryptography is a very old science, whose goal is to secure communication, so that only its recipient couldread it.
There are a lot of methods to encrypt a message,
From the simplest (such as the 2,000-year-old Caesarcipher) to the most complex (such as the World War 2 Enigma code);
They all need both encryption anddecryption keys (sometimes identical).
In some cases (such as the Hill cipher),
the key is represented by a matrix.You have to carry out such a matrix-based ciphering software,
using the following process to encrypt :

•Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first,

•Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size,and its number of lines should be as small as possible,

•Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message

# 104-Intersection

you need to write a 3 dimensional equation of the considered surface, and inject into it the equa-tion of the straight line representing the light ray. 
You’ll get a quadratic equation, with 0, 1, 2 or an infinitenumber of solutions that will give you the intersection points coordinates.The straight line is defined by the coordinates of a point by which it passes through and the coordinates ofa parallel vector.
Obeing the origin of the coordinate system, andX,YandZthe axis, the surfaces that must be handledin this project are:

•O-centered spheres,

•Cylinders of revolution aroundZaxis,

•Cones of revolution aroundZaxis whose apex is O.
